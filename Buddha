Recon

Host Discovery
    - for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done


Port Interrogation
    - nmap -sS -Pn <ip> -p 135-139,22,80,443,21,8080
          - May require sudo/proxychains
    - nc -z -v -w 1 <ip> <port>
     

Web-Server Ennumeration
    - proxychains wget -r http://<ip>:<port>
    - proxychains nmap -Pn -T5 -sT -p 80 --script http-enum.nse <IP>
    - proxychains nmap -Pn -T5 -sT -p 80 --script http-sql-injection.nse <IP>
    - proxychains nmap -Pn -T5 -sT -p 80 --script http-robots.txt.nse <IP>
    - nikto v -h <IP>

Gain Access to The public-facing web server. From there you can ennumerate the site through SQL injections. Be sure to check every file discovered
by your Scripts. You also need to gain access to the web server (if possible) via ssh. 

Files of Interest
    - cat /etc/sudoers
    - cat /etc/hosts
    - cat /etc/shadow

From your Web Server ssh session, unset HISTFILE and drop into a bash. Conduct further recon from your new pivot point. This means Host discovery
and port ennumeration.
